The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which had a Muslim majority population, was given the choice of joining either India or Pakistan. The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh, initially wanted to remain independent, but after an invasion by Pakistani-backed forces, he signed an Instrument of Accession with India in October 1947. Pakistan did not accept the Instrument of Accession and the two countries have been fighting over Kashmir ever since. The conflict has led to two wars between India and Pakistan, in 1947-1948 and 1965, and a number of armed skirmishes. The Kashmir conflict is a major source of tension between India and Pakistan and has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war."}

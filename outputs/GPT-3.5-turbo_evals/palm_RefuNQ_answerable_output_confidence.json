The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of Black people. War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina just over a month after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the president of the United States. The loyalists of the Union in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the Constitution. They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South, who advocated for states' rights to uphold slavery.\r\n\r\nOut of the 34 U.S. states, in February 1861, seven Southern slave states were declared, by partisans, to have seceded from the country, and the new Confederate States of America was proclaimed in Montgomery, Alabama. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border and Southern regions, and hostilities began. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in those eleven states (out of the 34 U.S. states in the beginning of the war) that had declared secession, as well as claiming the additional territories of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Tennessee and what was then the Indian Territory. The government of the United States was supported by the 23 remaining states and some southern unionists. These loyal states included California, Oregon, and after 1864, Nevada, all of which had joined the Union during the war.\r\n\r\nThe war effectively ended on April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Confederate generals throughout the Confederate army followed suit. The conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clean end date: land forces continued surrendering until June 23. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished leaving four million black slaves free, and the process of restoring the Union was underway during the Reconstruction Era (1865\u20131877). The war had a significant impact on the identity of the United States by leading to freedom for African Americans in the Reconstruction Era, and by helping to create a more unified national identity.

However, his reign was also marked by violence and oppression, and he is often seen as a tyrant. His story is one of ambition, power, and ultimately, tragedy.\n\nThere are several reasons why it is true that Qin Shihuang's story never ends. First, his legacy is still debated today. Some people see him as a great leader who unified China and brought peace to the country. Others see him as a tyrant who oppressed his people and caused great suffering.\n\nSecond, Qin Shihuang's tomb is still a mystery. It is said to be filled with treasures and traps, and no one has ever been able to find it. This has led to speculation and rumors about what might be inside the tomb, and it has kept Qin Shihuang's story alive for centuries.\n\nThird, Qin Shihuang's Terracotta Army is one of the most famous archaeological discoveries in history. The army is made up of over 8,000 life-size terracotta soldiers, and it is a testament to Qin Shihuang's power and ambition. The army has been on display in museums around the world, and it has helped to keep Qin Shihuang's story alive.\n\nFinally, Qin Shihuang's story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and power.

It is the right of all citizens to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. However, the right to vote is not always guaranteed. In some countries, only certain groups of people are allowed to vote, such as men, landowners, or people of a certain race or religion. In other countries, the right to vote is restricted by age, residency, or criminal record.\n\nThere are many reasons why it is important for everyone to have the right to vote. First, it allows people to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. When people are able to vote, they can choose the leaders who will represent them and make decisions on their behalf. This is important because it gives people a voice in government and helps to ensure that their interests are represented.\n\nSecond, the right to vote helps to promote equality and democracy. When everyone has the right to vote, it helps to ensure that all voices are heard and that no one group has more power than another. This is important because it helps to create a more just and equitable society.\n\nFinally, the right to vote is a fundamental human right. It is a right that is essential for a functioning democracy and for the protection of individual rights. Everyone, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or other characteristics, should have the right to vote.\n\nIn the United States, the right to vote is guaranteed by the 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the Constitution.

{"prompt": "Does honey bees usually have bigger wings than solitary bees.", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nHoney bees and solitary bees are both types of bees, but they have some key differences. One of these differences is the size of their wings. Honey bees typically have larger wings than solitary bees. This is because honey bees need to be able to fly long distances to collect nectar and pollen, while solitary bees do not.\n\nHoney bees are social insects, which means that they live in colonies. The queen bee lays eggs, and the worker bees take care of the larvae and build the honeycomb. Solitary bees, on the other hand, are not social insects. They live alone and do not build hives.\n\nHoney bees are important pollinators, and they play a vital role in the ecosystem. They help to pollinate crops, which are essential for human food production. Solitary bees are also pollinators, but they are not as important as honey bees.\n\nIn conclusion, honey bees typically have larger wings than solitary bees.

{"prompt": "Why does the size of the uterus remain the same after menstruation?", "label": 0, "palm": "[70]\n\nThe uterus is a muscular organ that is located in the lower abdomen. It is responsible for holding and nurturing a developing fetus during pregnancy. The size of the uterus varies throughout a woman's life, but it is typically about the size of a pear.\n\nDuring menstruation, the uterus sheds its lining in preparation for a new pregnancy. This process can cause the uterus to become swollen and tender. However, the size of the uterus typically returns to normal within a few days after menstruation.\n\nThere are a few reasons why the size of the uterus may remain the same after menstruation. One possibility is that the woman has a condition called endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This can cause the uterus to become enlarged and painful.\n\nAnother possibility is that the woman has a condition called fibroids. Fibroids are noncancerous tumors that can grow in the uterus. They can also cause the uterus to become enlarged and painful.\n\nFinally, it is also possible that the woman has a condition called adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue grows into the muscle wall of the uterus. This can also cause the uterus to become enlarged and painful.\n\nIf you are concerned about the size of your uterus, it is important to see a doctor.

{"prompt": "Why does bread make you full?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nBread is a complex carbohydrate, which means it takes longer for your body to digest than simple carbohydrates like sugar. This is because complex carbohydrates are made up of long chains of glucose molecules, which your body has to break down into individual glucose molecules before it can use them for energy. This process of digestion takes time, which is why you feel full after eating bread.\n\nIn addition, bread contains fiber, which is another type of complex carbohydrate. Fiber is not digested by your body, but it does help to keep you feeling full. This is because fiber absorbs water and forms a gel-like substance in your stomach. This gel slows down the emptying of your stomach, which helps to keep you feeling full for longer.\n\nFinally, bread contains protein. Protein is a macronutrient that is essential for building and repairing tissues. It also helps to keep you feeling full. This is because protein takes longer to digest than carbohydrates or fat. When you eat protein, your body has to break it down into amino acids before it can use it. This process of digestion takes time, which is why you feel full after eating protein.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Why do grapefruits grow faster in warm weather?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nGrapefruits are a type of citrus fruit that is native to the Americas. They are a hybrid of the pomelo and the sweet orange. Grapefruits are a good source of vitamins C and A, as well as fiber. They are also low in calories and fat.\n\nGrapefruits grow best in warm, humid climates. The ideal temperature for growing grapefruits is between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Grapefruits need full sun and well-drained soil. They are typically harvested in the fall.\n\nThere are several reasons why grapefruits grow faster in warm weather. First, warm weather promotes the growth of plants. Plants need sunlight to photosynthesize, which is the process by which they convert sunlight into energy. Warm weather also increases the rate of evaporation, which helps to transport water and nutrients to the plant's roots.\n\nSecond, warm weather reduces the risk of frost damage. Grapefruits are sensitive to frost, and even a light frost can damage the fruit or even kill the plant. Warm weather helps to protect grapefruits from frost damage.\n\nThird, warm weather increases the number of hours of daylight. Grapefruits need at least 12 hours of sunlight per day to grow properly. Warm weather provides more hours of daylight, which helps to promote the growth of grapefruits.\n\nOverall, there are several reasons why grapefruits grow faster in warm weather. Warm weather promotes the growth of plants, reduces the risk of frost damage, and increases the number of hours of daylight.", "palm_numerical": 80}

First, the country has a large population of elderly people who are more likely to be targeted by scammers. Second, the Chinese government has cracked down on traditional forms of crime, such as robbery and burglary, which has led criminals to turn to telemarketing fraud as an alternative source of income. Third, the Chinese legal system is not as well-equipped to deal with telemarketing fraud as it is with other types of crime. As a result, many scammers are able to get away with their crimes without being caught or punished.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that telemarketing fraud is not unique to China.

{"prompt": "If the human's stomach digest well, how long does it take digest food?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nThe time it takes for food to digest depends on a number of factors, including the type of food, the amount of food, and the health of the digestive system. In general, it takes about 24 hours for food to travel through the entire digestive system. However, it can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours for food to leave the stomach.\n\nThe stomach is a muscular sac that helps to break down food and absorb nutrients. The stomach produces gastric juices, which contain hydrochloric acid and enzymes that help to digest food. The stomach also churns food, which helps to mix it with gastric juices and break it down into smaller pieces.\n\nAfter food leaves the stomach, it enters the small intestine. The small intestine is about 20 feet long and is responsible for absorbing most of the nutrients from food. The small intestine is lined with millions of tiny finger-like projections called villi. The villi increase the surface area of the small intestine, which allows it to absorb more nutrients.\n\nAfter food is absorbed by the small intestine, it enters the large intestine. The large intestine is about 5 feet long and is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from food. The large intestine also stores waste products until they are eliminated from the body.\n\nThe time it takes for food to digest can vary depending on a number of factors. The type of food can affect the time it takes to digest. For example, protein takes longer to digest than carbohydrates. The amount of food can also affect the time it takes to digest. A large meal will take longer to digest than a small meal. The health of the digestive system can also affect the time it takes to digest. People with digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), may have a harder time digesting food.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "does a young cod grow faster in warm water than in magma?", "label": 0, "palm": "[50]\n\nI am not sure how to answer this question because I do not know the specific growth rates of cod in different temperatures. However, I can make some general observations about the effects of temperature on growth.\n\nIn general, most organisms grow faster at higher temperatures. This is because chemical reactions, which are essential for growth, occur more quickly at higher temperatures. However, there is a limit to how high the temperature can be before growth slows down or stops. This is because high temperatures can damage cells and proteins, which are essential for growth.\n\nMagma is much hotter than warm water, so it is likely that cod would not be able to grow in magma. However, I do not know for sure how hot the magma would have to be to prevent growth.", "palm_numerical": 50}
{"prompt": "List a reason why do trees die in the drought?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nTrees need water to survive. When there is a drought, trees do not get enough water and they can die. There are a few reasons why trees die in a drought.\n\n* **Water stress:** Trees need water to transport nutrients and minerals from the roots to the leaves. When there is a drought, trees do not get enough water and they cannot transport these nutrients and minerals. This can cause the leaves to turn yellow and fall off.\n* **Heat stress:** Trees also need water to cool themselves down. When there is a drought, trees cannot cool themselves down and they can overheat. This can cause the leaves to turn brown and fall off.\n* **Fire:** Droughts can also lead to wildfires. Wildfires can kill trees by burning them or by damaging their roots.\n* **Insects and diseases:** Droughts can also make trees more susceptible to insects and diseases. Insects and diseases can kill trees by feeding on them or by spreading diseases.", "palm_numerical": 90}

However, the exact timing can vary depending on the breed of goat and the individual goat. Some goats may start growing horns as early as 4 months old, while others may not start until they are a year old or older.\n\nThe rate at which goats grow horns also varies. Some goats may grow their horns very quickly, while others may grow them more slowly. The rate of growth is also affected by the goat's diet and health.\n\nGoat horns are made of keratin, the same material that makes up human hair and nails. They are typically curved and pointed, and they can grow to be quite large. The size of the horns is also affected by the breed of goat. Some breeds of goats, such as the Boer goat, have very large horns, while others, such as the Nigerian Dwarf goat, have much smaller horns.\n\nGoat horns are used for a variety of purposes. They can be used for protection, for fighting, and for display. Goats also use their horns to help them climb and to scratch themselves.\n\nIn some cultures, goat horns are used for decorative purposes. They may be carved or painted, and they may be used to make jewelry or other objects.\n\nGoat horns are also used for practical purposes. They can be used to make tools, such as knives and axes. They can also be used to make musical instruments, such as the didgeridoo.\n\nOverall, goat horns are an important part of the goat's anatomy.

The peel of a banana also changes color as it ripens, from green to yellow to brown.\n\nSome people prefer the taste of green bananas, while others prefer the taste of yellow bananas. There is no right or wrong answer, it is simply a matter of personal preference.\n\nThere are a few reasons why yellow bananas may taste better than green bananas. First, the sugars in yellow bananas are more easily absorbed by the body, which can lead to a sweeter taste. Second, the starches in green bananas can be difficult to digest, which can lead to a gassy feeling. Finally, the peel of a yellow banana is softer and easier to peel, which can make it more enjoyable to eat.\n\nUltimately, the best way to determine whether you prefer the taste of green or yellow bananas is to try both and see which one you like better.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "If snake grown up, how often is it molt?", "label": 0, "palm": "[75]\n\nSnakes molt as they grow, and the frequency of molting depends on the species of snake and its age. Young snakes molt more often than adults, and some snakes may molt as often as once a month. Adult snakes may molt only once or twice a year.\n\nThe molting process is a complex one that involves shedding the old skin and growing a new one. The snake's body produces enzymes that help to loosen the old skin, and the snake then rubs against rough surfaces to help remove it. The new skin is soft and pliable at first, but it hardens over time.\n\nMolting is an important process for snakes, as it allows them to grow and shed any parasites that may be living on their skin.

The frequency of shedding depends on the species of snake, but most snakes shed their skin once every few months. Some snakes, such as pythons and boas, can go for up to a year without shedding.\n\nThe shedding process begins when the snake's old skin starts to loosen. The snake will rub against rough surfaces to help loosen the skin, and it may also eat its old skin. Once the skin is loose, the snake will wriggle out of it, starting at the head and working its way down the body.\n\nAfter shedding, the snake's new skin is soft and shiny. It will take a few days for the new skin to harden and dry. During this time, the snake is more vulnerable to predators, so it will usually stay hidden.", "palm_numerical": 90}

Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220\u2013206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644).\n\nThe Great Wall is often mistakenly referred to as one continuous structure; in fact, it consists of numerous fortifications built over a period of centuries. Construction techniques and materials varied over time and from place to place, but most walls were built by cutting into the earth and then filling the trench with stone, brick, tamped earth, or wood. The walls were then topped with a parapet and a walkway.\n\nThe Great Wall was built for a variety of reasons, including defense, trade, and communication. The wall was used to protect China from invaders from the north, and it also served as a trade route between China and the rest of the world. The wall was also used as a means of communication, as smoke signals could be sent along the wall to warn of approaching enemies.\n\nThe Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular tourist destinations in China.

{"prompt": "If a diver swims deeper, why the water pressure will increase?", "label": 0, "palm": "[99]\n\nThe pressure of water increases with depth because the weight of the water above exerts a force on the water below. This force is called pressure. The deeper you go, the more water there is above you, and the greater the pressure.\n\nThe pressure of water is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$P = \\rho g h$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $P$ is the pressure in pascals (Pa)\n* $\\rho$ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3)\n* $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared (m/s2)\n* $h$ is the depth in meters (m)\n\nThe density of water is approximately 1,000 kg/m3, and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s2. Therefore, the pressure of water at a depth of 10 meters is approximately:\n\n$P = 1,000 \\times 9.8 \\times 10 = 98,000 \\text{ Pa}$\n\nThis is equivalent to about 1 atmosphere of pressure.", "palm_numerical": 99}

This is a significant number, and it is important to remember that each elephant that is killed is an individual with a family and a social group. The loss of these elephants has a devastating impact on the ecosystems they live in.\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to the poaching of elephants. One factor is the demand for ivory in Asia, where it is used to make jewelry and other decorative items. Another factor is the lack of law enforcement in many areas where elephants live. Poachers often operate with impunity, and there are few consequences for their actions.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to address the problem of elephant poaching.

{"prompt": "How long did it take the astronomer Copernicus to publish the heliocentric theory?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nNicolaus Copernicus was a Polish astronomer who formulated a model of the universe that placed the Sun, rather than the Earth, at the center. This heliocentric model was published in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543, just a few months before his death.\n\nCopernicus began working on his heliocentric model in the early 1500s, but he did not publish it until he was in his 70s. There are several reasons why it took him so long to publish his work. First, he was aware that his ideas would be controversial, and he wanted to make sure that they were as accurate as possible. Second, he was a cautious man, and he did not want to publish his work until he was sure that it would be accepted by the scientific community.\n\nCopernicus's heliocentric model was a radical departure from the geocentric model that had been accepted for centuries. The geocentric model placed the Earth at the center of the universe, with the Sun, Moon, and planets orbiting around it. Copernicus's heliocentric model placed the Sun at the center of the universe, with the Earth and other planets orbiting around it.\n\nCopernicus's heliocentric model was not immediately accepted by the scientific community. In fact, it was met with a great deal of opposition. However, over time, Copernicus's model gained acceptance, and it eventually became the accepted model of the universe.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Why shouldn't people with hypertension eat more fatty meat?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nPeople with hypertension should avoid eating fatty meat because it can raise their blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Eating fatty meat can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why fatty meat can raise blood pressure. First, fatty meat is high in saturated fat. Saturated fat is a type of fat that can raise LDL cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol because it can build up in the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nSecond, fatty meat is high in sodium. Sodium is a mineral that can cause the body to retain water. This can lead to an increase in blood pressure.\n\nThird, fatty meat is low in potassium. Potassium is a mineral that can help to lower blood pressure.\n\nPeople with hypertension should limit their intake of fatty meat. Instead, they should choose lean meats, such as chicken or fish. They should also eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are low in saturated fat and sodium and high in potassium.", "palm_numerical": 90}

The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius. The boiling point of oil is much higher than the boiling point of water. This is because oil is a non-polar molecule, while water is a polar molecule. Non-polar molecules are not attracted to each other as strongly as polar molecules. This means that it takes more energy to break the bonds between the molecules in oil, which is why oil has a higher boiling point than water.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Why the more breads I eat, the more thirsty I am?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nBread is a high-carbohydrate food. When you eat carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which is then used for energy. However, your body can only use so much glucose at once, and the rest is converted into glycogen and stored in your liver and muscles. When you run low on glucose, your body releases hormones that signal your brain to make you feel hungry.\n\nOne of the side effects of low blood sugar is thirst. This is because your body needs water to help it absorb glucose from the bloodstream. So, if you eat a lot of bread, you may find yourself feeling thirsty afterwards.\n\nIn addition, bread is a dry food. When you eat dry foods, your body needs to drink more water to help keep your mouth and throat moist. So, if you eat a lot of bread, you may find yourself feeling thirsty afterwards.\n\nFinally, bread is often eaten with other foods that are high in salt, such as cheese or butter. Salt can dehydrate you, so if you eat a lot of bread and salty foods, you may find yourself feeling thirsty afterwards.\n\nIf you find yourself feeling thirsty after eating bread, there are a few things you can do to help:\n\n* Drink plenty of water.\n* Eat fruits and vegetables, which are high in water content.\n* Avoid salty foods.\n* Eat smaller meals more often.", "palm_numerical": 80}

These materials include down, feathers, polyester, and memory foam. Down and feathers are the most common materials used in pillows, and they are both very soft and fluffy. Polyester is a synthetic material that is often used in pillows because it is durable and affordable. Memory foam is a type of foam that is designed to conform to the shape of your head and neck, which can provide additional comfort.\n\nThe softness of a pillow is also affected by its filling. Pillows that are filled with down or feathers are typically softer than pillows that are filled with polyester or memory foam. This is because down and feathers are more lightweight and fluffy, while polyester and memory foam are more dense.\n\nThe temperature of a pillow can also affect its softness. Pillows that are stored in a cold environment will be stiffer than pillows that are stored in a warm environment. This is because the cold temperature causes the materials in the pillow to contract, which makes them less flexible.\n\nWhen you put your head on a pillow, the heat from your body will warm the pillow and make it softer. This is why pillows often feel softer after you have been sleeping on them for a while.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Why antibiotics kill bacterium?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nAntibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their ability to grow and reproduce. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by inhibiting the synthesis of cell walls, disrupting the function of ribosomes, or interfering with DNA replication.\n\nSome antibiotics are more effective against certain types of bacteria than others. This is because bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics over time. This means that the antibiotic is no longer effective in killing the bacteria.\n\nIt is important to use antibiotics only when necessary and to complete the full course of treatment, even if you start to feel better. This will help to prevent the bacteria from developing resistance.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Where will cellls die?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nCells can die in a variety of places, depending on the type of cell and the cause of death. Some common places where cells die include:\n\n* The cell's own cytoplasm\n* The extracellular space\n* The nucleus\n* The mitochondria\n* The lysosomes\n\nThe specific location of cell death can have important implications for the health of the organism as a whole. For example, if cells die in the extracellular space, they can release harmful toxins that can damage other cells. If cells die in the nucleus, they can release genetic material that can trigger cancer.\n\nThe cause of cell death can also affect the location of cell death. For example, cells that die due to apoptosis (programmed cell death) typically die in the cell's own cytoplasm. Cells that die due to necrosis (accidental cell death) typically die in the extracellular space.\n\nIn general, cells die when they are no longer able to function properly. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n* Damage to the cell's DNA\n* Lack of nutrients\n* Exposure to toxins\n* Infection by viruses or bacteria\n\nWhen a cell dies, it typically undergoes a series of changes, including:\n\n* The collapse of the cell membrane\n* The release of cellular contents into the extracellular space\n* The activation of enzymes that break down the cell's components\n\nThe death of cells is a normal part of life. However, if too many cells die, it can lead to serious health problems. For example, the death of brain cells can lead to Alzheimer's disease. The death of heart cells can lead to heart failure.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to prevent cell death, including:\n\n* Avoiding exposure to toxins\n* Eating a healthy diet\n* Getting enough exercise\n* Managing stress\n* Getting enough sleep\n\nIf you are concerned about cell death, you should talk to your doctor.", "palm_numerical": 90}

It is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin, hair and eyes their color.\n\nAlbinism is a genetic disorder, which means it is passed down from parents to children. The gene mutation that causes albinism is recessive, which means that both parents must carry the gene for their child to be born with albinism.\n\nThere is no cure for albinism, but there are treatments that can help people with albinism manage their condition. These treatments include wearing sunscreen, protective clothing and sunglasses, and avoiding activities that can expose the skin to the sun.\n\nPeople with albinism are more susceptible to sunburn, skin cancer and eye problems. They may also have vision problems, such as nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), photophobia (sensitivity to light) and strabismus (crossed eyes).\n\nDespite the challenges they face, people with albinism can live full and productive lives.

{"prompt": "Why there are just two season in the Antarctic?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nThe Antarctic is a continent located in the Earth's Southern Hemisphere, mostly south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent, after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. For most of the year, Antarctica is covered in snow and ice. The continent has a very cold climate, with an average temperature of -57 degrees Celsius (-70 degrees Fahrenheit). The Antarctic is also very windy, with average wind speeds of 16 kilometers per hour (10 miles per hour).\n\nThe Antarctic has two seasons: summer and winter. Summer in the Antarctic lasts from November to March, and winter lasts from April to October. During the summer, the sun shines 24 hours a day, and the temperature is relatively warm, with an average temperature of -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit). During the winter, the sun does not rise at all, and the temperature is very cold, with an average temperature of -57 degrees Celsius (-70 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe reason why there are just two seasons in the Antarctic is because the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes the Earth to receive different amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. During the summer, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. This means that the Northern Hemisphere receives more sunlight, and the Southern Hemisphere receives less sunlight. During the winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, and the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. This means that the Southern Hemisphere receives more sunlight, and the Northern Hemisphere receives less sunlight.\n\nThe Antarctic is located in the Southern Hemisphere, so it experiences winter when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing summer. This is why there are just two seasons in the Antarctic: summer and winter.", "palm_numerical": 90}

The speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792,458 meters per second, while the speed of sound in air is about 343 meters per second. This means that light travels about 880,000 times faster than sound.\n\nWhen an object emits light, the light waves travel away from the object in all directions. The light waves travel until they reach our eyes, where they are converted into electrical signals that are sent to our brains. Our brains interpret these electrical signals as images.\n\nWhen an object emits sound, the sound waves travel away from the object in all directions. The sound waves travel until they reach our ears, where they are converted into mechanical vibrations that are sent to our brains. Our brains interpret these mechanical vibrations as sound.\n\nBecause light travels much faster than sound, we always see light before we hear sound. For example, if a car horn honks, we will see the car's headlights before we hear the sound of the horn.", "palm_numerical": 99}

{"prompt": "How does a cape make you warm?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nA cape is a piece of clothing that is worn over the shoulders and hangs down the back. It is typically made of a thick, warm material such as wool or fur. When worn, a cape traps heat close to the body, which helps to keep the wearer warm.\n\nThere are several ways in which a cape can make you warm. First, the cape acts as an insulator. It traps heat close to the body, preventing it from escaping into the environment. This is similar to how a blanket keeps you warm in bed.\n\nSecond, the cape can help to block the wind. When the wind blows, it can carry away heat from the body. A cape can help to prevent this by creating a barrier between the body and the wind.\n\nThird, the cape can help to reflect heat back to the body. When sunlight hits a cape, some of the heat is reflected back to the body. This is similar to how a mirror reflects light.\n\nFinally, the cape can help to trap moisture. When you sweat, the moisture evaporates into the air. This can help to cool you down. However, if you are wearing a cape, the moisture will be trapped close to your body. This will help to keep you warm.\n\nOverall, there are several ways in which a cape can make you warm.

{"prompt": "Name one reason why can wood burn?", "label": 0, "palm": "[99]\n\nWood is a combustible material, which means it can catch fire and burn. This is because wood is made up of cellulose, which is a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. When wood is heated, the carbon and hydrogen atoms react with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. This reaction releases heat, which causes the wood to continue to burn.\n\nThe rate at which wood burns depends on a number of factors, including the type of wood, the moisture content of the wood, the temperature of the wood, and the amount of oxygen available. Hardwoods, such as oak and maple, burn more slowly than softwoods, such as pine and fir. Wood that is dry burns more easily than wood that is wet. Wood that is heated to a high temperature burns more quickly than wood that is heated to a lower temperature. And wood that has more oxygen available burns more quickly than wood that has less oxygen available.\n\nWood can be used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and generating electricity. It can also be used to make paper, furniture, and other products.", "palm_numerical": 99}

The figures, buried in three pits 800 meters (2,600 ft) east of his tomb, were discovered in 1974 by a group of farmers digging a well.\n\nThe army consists of more than 8,000 life-size terracotta soldiers, each with its own unique facial expression and hairstyle. The soldiers are arranged in battle formation, with chariots and horses. The figures are made of clay and were originally painted. The army is a remarkable example of Chinese art and engineering, and it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in China.\n\nThe Terracotta Warriors were made of clay because it was a readily available material that could be easily shaped and molded. Clay was also a relatively inexpensive material, which made it a good choice for a large-scale project like the Terracotta Army.\n\nThe clay used to make the Terracotta Warriors was sourced from a nearby riverbed. The clay was then mixed with water and other materials to create a workable dough. The dough was then shaped into the desired figures, which were then left to dry in the sun.

{"prompt": "Why don't the hydrogen balloons fall to the land?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nHydrogen balloons float because they are less dense than air. The density of an object is its mass divided by its volume. The density of air is about 1.225 kg/m3, while the density of hydrogen is about 0.0899 kg/m3. This means that a hydrogen balloon will have a volume that is about 14 times greater than the volume of an object of the same mass that is made of air.\n\nThe upward force on an object in a fluid is called buoyancy. Buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. The weight of a fluid is equal to its density times its volume. So, the buoyancy on a hydrogen balloon is equal to the weight of the air that the balloon displaces.\n\nThe weight of the air that a hydrogen balloon displaces is equal to the mass of the air that the balloon displaces times the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the air that the balloon displaces is equal to the density of the air times the volume of the balloon. So, the buoyancy on a hydrogen balloon is equal to the density of the air times the volume of the balloon times the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is a constant, so the buoyancy on a hydrogen balloon is proportional to the density of the air and the volume of the balloon. The density of the air is a constant, so the buoyancy on a hydrogen balloon is proportional to the volume of the balloon.\n\nSince the volume of a hydrogen balloon is about 14 times greater than the volume of an object of the same mass that is made of air, the buoyancy on a hydrogen balloon is about 14 times greater than the buoyancy on an object of the same mass that is made of air. This is why hydrogen balloons float.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "How much meat does a lion need per day?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nThe amount of meat a lion needs per day depends on a number of factors, including its age, sex, and activity level. A typical adult lion will eat around 10-15 pounds of meat per day, but this can vary depending on the circumstances. For example, a lactating lioness will need to eat more meat to support her cubs, and a lion that is hunting in a particularly difficult environment may need to eat more to maintain its energy levels.\n\nThere are a number of ways to estimate how much meat a lion needs. One way is to look at the amount of meat that lions typically eat in the wild. Studies have shown that lions in the wild typically eat around 10-15 pounds of meat per day. However, this can vary depending on the location and the availability of prey. For example, lions in areas with a lot of prey may eat more meat than lions in areas with less prey.\n\nAnother way to estimate how much meat a lion needs is to look at the amount of meat that lions are fed in captivity. Lions in captivity are typically fed around 10-15 pounds of meat per day. However, this can vary depending on the size of the lion and the type of meat that is being fed. For example, a large lion may need to eat more meat than a small lion, and a lion that is being fed a high-quality diet may need to eat less meat than a lion that is being fed a low-quality diet.\n\nUltimately, the best way to determine how much meat a lion needs is to consult with a veterinarian or animal nutritionist. These professionals can take into account all of the factors that affect a lion's dietary needs and recommend an appropriate diet.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "How much air does a man breathe in per year?", "label": 0, "palm": "[75]\n\nThe amount of air a person breathes in per year depends on a number of factors, including their age, sex, activity level, and health. However, a typical adult breathes in about 12,000 to 15,000 liters of air per day. This means that a person breathes in about 4.3 to 5.4 million liters of air per year.\n\nThere are a number of ways to estimate how much air a person breathes in per year. One way is to use a spirometer, which is a device that measures the volume of air that a person can breathe in and out. Another way is to use a gas analyzer, which measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in a person's breath.\n\nThe amount of air a person breathes in per year can also be estimated based on their body weight. A study published in the journal \"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\" found that men who weigh 150 pounds breathe in about 12,000 liters of air per day, while women who weigh 120 pounds breathe in about 10,000 liters of air per day.\n\nThe amount of air a person breathes in per year can also be affected by their activity level. People who are more active tend to breathe in more air than people who are less active. This is because active people need more oxygen to fuel their muscles.\n\nThe amount of air a person breathes in per year can also be affected by their health. People with respiratory problems, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tend to breathe in more air than people who do not have these conditions. This is because people with respiratory problems have difficulty breathing and need to take more breaths to get the oxygen they need.\n\nOverall, the amount of air a person breathes in per year depends on a number of factors. However, a typical adult breathes in about 12,000 to 15,000 liters of air per day. This means that a person breathes in about 4.3 to 5.4 million liters of air per year.", "palm_numerical": 75}

{"prompt": "What kind of exercise does people do to keep healthy? Yoga or Taiji?", "label": 0, "palm": "[95]\n\nBoth yoga and taiji are forms of exercise that can be beneficial for health. Yoga is a mind and body practice with a 5,000-year history in ancient Indian philosophy. Various styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation or relaxation. Taiji is a gentle form of Chinese martial art that combines slow, graceful movements with deep breathing. It is often practiced for its health benefits, such as improved balance, flexibility, and muscle strength.\n\nBoth yoga and taiji can be beneficial for health, but they are different in some ways.

While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.\n\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, a poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive drinking of alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5\u201310% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.\n\nMany cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, and avoiding too much processed and red meat. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.\n\nIn children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%. For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66%. In children under 15 at diagnosis, the most common types of cancer are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (32%), brain tumors (26%), and lymphoma (14%). In adults, the most common types of cancer are breast cancer (25%), lung cancer (13%), and colorectal cancer (10%). In 2020, about 9.5 million people died from cancer.\n\nThe earliest known mention of cancer is in a Sumerian clay tablet from 2100 BC. The Ebers Papyrus from Egypt, written around 1550 BC, contains a description of breast cancer and a recipe for treating it. The Greek physician Hippocrates (460\u2013370 BC) was the first to describe the four main types of cancer: breast, lung, stomach, and skin. He also coined the term \"cancer\". The Roman physician Galen (130\u2013200 AD) was the first to describe the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, cancer was thought to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. This belief persisted until the 17th century, when the English physician Thomas Willis (1621\u20131675) proposed that cancer was caused by a growth of abnormal cells.\n\nIn the 19th century, the German physician Rudolf Virchow (1821\u20131902) discovered that cancer is caused by changes in the DNA of cells. This discovery led to the development of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which are now the main treatments for cancer.\n\nIn the 20th century, the American physician James Ewing (1866\u20131943) developed the Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone cancer. The American physician Vincent DeVita (born 1935) developed the DeVita-Hellman protocol, a chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma. The American physician Vincent T. DeVita Jr. (born 1935) developed the DeVita-Hellman protocol, a chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nIn the 21st century, there have been many advances in the treatment of cancer. New drugs have been developed, and new surgical techniques have been developed. Cancer is now a much more treatable disease than it was in the past.", "palm_numerical": 90}
{"prompt": "Why birds can fly?", "label": 0, "palm": "[95]\n\nBirds can fly because they have a number of adaptations that make flight possible. These include hollow bones, feathers, a strong chest muscle called the pectoralis major, and a four-chambered heart.\n\nHollow bones make birds lightweight, which is important for flight. Feathers provide lift and help birds to control their flight. The pectoralis major muscle is used to flap the wings, and the four-chambered heart provides the birds with the oxygen they need to fly.\n\nIn addition to these physical adaptations, birds also have a number of behavioral adaptations that help them to fly. For example, they often take off into the wind, which helps them to gain altitude. They also use their wings to steer and to land.\n\nOverall, birds have a number of adaptations that make flight possible. These adaptations include hollow bones, feathers, a strong chest muscle called the pectoralis major, and a four-chambered heart.

{"prompt": "When will children grow into an adult?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nPuberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain and the adrenal glands. The process of puberty is controlled by the hypothalamus, a small region of the brain that regulates many body functions. The hypothalamus releases hormones that stimulate the pituitary gland, which in turn releases hormones that stimulate the adrenal glands and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). These hormones cause the body to produce sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. Sex hormones are responsible for the physical changes that occur during puberty, such as the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair.\n\nThe onset of puberty varies from person to person. In girls, puberty typically begins between the ages of 8 and 13. In boys, puberty typically begins between the ages of 9 and 14. The duration of puberty also varies from person to person. In girls, puberty typically lasts for about 4 years. In boys, puberty typically lasts for about 5 years.\n\nThe physical changes that occur during puberty are caused by the increase in sex hormones. These changes include:\n\n* The development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair\n* The growth of the body, including the height and weight\n* The development of the reproductive organs\n* The onset of menstruation in girls\n* The development of sperm production in boys\n\nThe physical changes that occur during puberty can be both exciting and challenging.

This makes them a sustainable source of food, especially in areas where other types of livestock cannot be raised.\n\nAnother reason for the popularity of pork is its taste. Pork is a flavorful meat that can be cooked in many different ways. It can be roasted, grilled, fried, or smoked, and it can be used in a variety of dishes.\n\nFinally, pork is a good source of protein, iron, and zinc. Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, while iron is necessary for carrying oxygen in the blood. Zinc is important for immune function and wound healing.\n\nAll of these factors have contributed to the popularity of pork as a food source. It is a versatile, flavorful, and nutritious meat that is enjoyed by people all over the world.", "palm_numerical": 70}

The average cancer cell is about 10 micrometers in diameter, while the human eye can only see objects that are about 0.1 millimeters in diameter. This means that cancer cells are about 100 times smaller than the smallest object that the human eye can see.\n\nIn addition, cancer cells are not very dense. They are made up mostly of water, and they do not have a lot of structure. This makes them difficult to see even with a microscope.\n\nFinally, cancer cells are often surrounded by healthy cells. This makes it difficult to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy cells.", "palm_numerical": 90}
{"prompt": "Why do people with strong immune systems not to be prone to infection?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nPeople with strong immune systems are less likely to get sick because their bodies are better able to fight off infection. A strong immune system can be developed through a combination of factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and vaccinations.\n\nGenetics play a role in determining how strong a person's immune system is. Some people are born with naturally strong immune systems, while others are more susceptible to infection.\n\nLifestyle choices can also affect the strength of the immune system. People who eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and get enough sleep are more likely to have strong immune systems than those who do not.\n\nVaccinations are another important way to protect the immune system. Vaccines help the body develop immunity to specific diseases, so that if a person is exposed to the disease, their body will be able to fight it off.\n\nOverall, there are a number of factors that can affect the strength of the immune system. People who have strong immune systems are less likely to get sick, and they are also more likely to recover quickly from illness if they do get sick.", "palm_numerical": 90}

Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220\u2013206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644).\n\nThe Great Wall stretches from Dandong in Liaoning Province in the east to Lop Lake in Gansu Province in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the historical northern border of China. Several walls built as early as the 7th century BC joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220\u2013206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains.

The fastest way to get to the Great Wall from Beijing is by car. The drive takes about two hours. There are also several tour companies that offer day trips to the Great Wall from Beijing.\n\nIf you are driving to the Great Wall, you will need to take the G6 Beijing-Shenyang Expressway. The exit for the Great Wall is called \"Badaling.\" Once you exit the expressway, you will need to follow the signs to the Great Wall.\n\nThe Great Wall is open year-round. However, the best time to visit is during the spring (April to May) or autumn (September to October) when the weather is mild. The summer (June to August) can be very hot and humid, and the winter (December to February) can be very cold and snowy.\n\nThere are several different sections of the Great Wall that you can visit. The most popular section is Badaling, which is about 70 kilometers from Beijing. Badaling is the most accessible section of the Great Wall, and it is also the most crowded. If you are looking for a more peaceful experience, you can visit one of the less popular sections of the Great Wall, such as Mutianyu or Jinshanling.\n\nThe cost of visiting the Great Wall varies depending on the section of the wall that you visit. The entrance fee for Badaling is 40 yuan for adults and 20 yuan for children. The entrance fee for Mutianyu is 60 yuan for adults and 30 yuan for children. The entrance fee for Jinshanling is 40 yuan for adults and 20 yuan for children.\n\nIf you are planning to visit the Great Wall, you should wear comfortable shoes and clothing that is appropriate for the weather.

In the United States, for example, basic education typically consists of 12 years of schooling, from kindergarten through 12th grade. In some other countries, such as Germany, basic education may only consist of 9 years of schooling.\n\nThere are a number of factors that can affect the length of basic education, including the country's economic development, its cultural values, and its educational system. In general, countries with higher levels of economic development tend to have longer periods of basic education. This is because these countries have more resources to invest in education, and they see education as an important investment in their future.\n\nCultural values can also play a role in determining the length of basic education. In some cultures, education is seen as a way to prepare children for a specific career or occupation. In other cultures, education is seen as a way to develop children's minds and prepare them for life in general. These different views on education can lead to different expectations about the length of basic education.\n\nFinally, the educational system can also affect the length of basic education. In some countries, basic education is compulsory, meaning that all children are required to attend school. In other countries, basic education is not compulsory, and parents can choose whether or not to send their children to school. This can also lead to differences in the length of basic education.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of basic education varies from country to country.

{"prompt": "Why does natural gas will run out one day?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nNatural gas is a fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that have been buried and subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. It is a non-renewable resource, which means that it cannot be replaced once it is used up. The Earth's natural gas reserves are finite, and they are being depleted at an ever-increasing rate. As a result, it is inevitable that natural gas will run out one day.\n\nThe exact date when natural gas will run out is unknown, but it is estimated that it could happen within the next 100 years. This is a significant concern, as natural gas is a major source of energy for many countries around the world. If natural gas runs out, it will have a major impact on the global economy and on the way that we live our lives.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to reduce our reliance on natural gas and to extend the life of our natural gas reserves. One option is to switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Another option is to improve energy efficiency, so that we use less natural gas overall. By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that natural gas is available for future generations.", "palm_numerical": 90}

There is no scientific consensus on whether or not aliens exist, but there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that they may.\n\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the existence of aliens is the fact that the universe is vast. There are billions of galaxies in the universe, each containing billions of stars. It is estimated that there are at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy alone. Given the sheer number of planets in the universe, it seems likely that at least some of them could support life.\n\nAnother piece of evidence for the existence of aliens is the fact that we have already found evidence of life on other planets. In 1996, scientists discovered evidence of fossilized bacteria in a meteorite that originated from Mars. This discovery suggests that Mars may have once been habitable, and that life may have once existed there.\n\nWhile there is no definitive proof that aliens exist, the evidence suggests that they may.

{"prompt": "When do rain and snow exist simultaneously?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nRain and snow can exist simultaneously when the temperature at the surface is above freezing but the temperature at higher altitudes is below freezing. This can happen in the spring or fall, when the weather is transitioning from winter to summer or vice versa. When this happens, the raindrops that fall from the clouds may melt as they pass through the warmer air near the ground, but they may refreeze as they fall through the colder air higher up. This can result in raindrops that are partially melted and partially frozen, or even in snow that is mixed with rain.", "palm_numerical": 80}

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.\n\nCurie was born Maria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Floating University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronis\u0142awa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nDuring World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals. In 1921, she became the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris. She died in 1934, aged 66, from aplastic anemia, a condition that was later attributed to her exposure to radiation.\n\nCurie's achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today.\n\nCurie's legacy is immense. She is one of the most famous scientists of all time, and her work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the physical world. She is also a role model for women in science, and her story is an inspiration to many.", "palm_numerical": 95}

{"prompt": "Why can wood burn?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nWood can burn because it is made up of cellulose, which is a complex carbohydrate. Cellulose is made up of long chains of glucose molecules, which are simple sugars. When wood is heated, the cellulose breaks down into these glucose molecules. The glucose molecules then react with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide and water. This reaction releases heat, which is what causes the wood to burn.\n\nThe rate at which wood burns depends on a number of factors, including the type of wood, the moisture content of the wood, and the amount of oxygen available. Hardwoods, such as oak and maple, burn more slowly than softwoods, such as pine and fir. Wood that is dry burns more quickly than wood that is wet. And wood that has a lot of oxygen available burns more quickly than wood that has less oxygen available.\n\nThe heat from burning wood can be used for a variety of purposes, such as cooking, heating, and generating electricity.

His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, esthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\n* Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, taxonomist and physician. He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\", and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of science. Linnaeus is best known for his binomial nomenclature, a system of naming organisms that is still in use today. He also developed a system of classification for plants and animals, which is still used as a basis for modern taxonomy.\n* Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk and scientist who is considered the father of genetics. Mendel's work on pea plants laid the foundation for the science of genetics, and his laws of inheritance are still used today to understand how genes are passed down from parents to offspring.\n* Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of science. Pasteur is best known for his work on fermentation, pasteurization, and vaccination.

{"prompt": "Why are white ants bad for trees?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nWhite ants, also known as termites, are social insects that live in colonies. They are considered to be pests because they can damage wood and other materials. White ants are attracted to trees because they provide a source of food and shelter. They can damage trees by eating the bark, wood, and roots. This can weaken the tree and make it more susceptible to disease and pests. In severe cases, white ants can kill a tree.\n\nThere are a number of ways to control white ants. One way is to use insecticides. However, insecticides can be harmful to the environment and to other insects. Another way to control white ants is to use baits. Baits are made with a substance that is attractive to white ants. When the ants eat the bait, they die.\n\nIt is important to prevent white ants from infesting trees. One way to do this is to keep trees healthy. Healthy trees are less likely to be infested by white ants. Another way to prevent white ants is to seal any cracks or openings in the foundation of your home.

It is the largest known carnivorous dinosaur, with a length of up to 18 meters (59 feet) and a weight of up to 20 tons (22 short tons). Spinosaurus is characterized by its long, narrow snout, sail-like structure on its back, and large, robust forelimbs.\n\nThe diet of Spinosaurus is a matter of debate. Some scientists believe that it was a piscivore, or fish-eater, while others believe that it was an omnivore, or an animal that ate both plants and animals. There is evidence to support both hypotheses. For example, the teeth of Spinosaurus are similar to those of other fish-eating dinosaurs, and its sail may have been used to attract prey. However, Spinosaurus also had features that are more typical of herbivorous dinosaurs, such as a broad skull and a long neck.\n\nThe confidence score of 80 reflects the fact that there is still some uncertainty about the diet of Spinosaurus. However, the evidence suggests that it was a piscivore, or fish-eater.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "Why can blood flow?", "label": 0, "palm": "[95]\n\nBlood flow is the continuous movement of blood through the cardiovascular system. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the body, and removes waste products. Blood flow is driven by the heart, which pumps blood through the arteries. The arteries branch into smaller and smaller vessels, called arterioles, which then branch into capillaries. The capillaries are the smallest blood vessels, and they are where the exchange of oxygen and nutrients takes place. The capillaries then join together to form venules, which then join together to form veins. The veins return blood to the heart.\n\nThere are a number of factors that affect blood flow, including the heart rate, blood pressure, and the viscosity of blood. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. The blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries. The viscosity of blood is the thickness of blood.\n\nBlood flow is important for maintaining a healthy body. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and removes waste products. Blood flow also helps to regulate body temperature.", "palm_numerical": 95}

{"prompt": "How will they work if we inject vaccines into our bodies?", "label": 0, "palm": "[95]\n\nVaccines work by exposing the body to a weakened or inactivated form of a virus or bacteria, which causes the body to produce antibodies that can fight off the real virus or bacteria if it is ever encountered. This is called active immunity.\n\nWhen a vaccine is injected into the body, the immune system responds by producing antibodies that attack the virus or bacteria. These antibodies then remain in the body, providing protection against future infection.\n\nVaccines are very effective at preventing disease. For example, the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles. This means that if 100 people are vaccinated against measles, only 3 of them will get the disease if they are exposed to it.\n\nVaccines are also very safe. The vast majority of people who get vaccinated do not experience any serious side effects. The most common side effects of vaccines are mild and go away on their own within a few days.\n\nVaccines are one of the most important public health tools we have.

{"prompt": "How cancer cells kill people?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nCancer cells can kill people in a number of ways. They can grow and spread to other parts of the body, where they can damage healthy tissue and organs. They can also interfere with the body's ability to fight infection and disease. In some cases, cancer cells can release toxins that can damage the body's cells and tissues.\n\nThe specific way in which cancer cells kill people depends on the type of cancer and the stage of the disease. For example, lung cancer is often caused by the growth of abnormal cells in the lungs. These cells can spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, bones, and liver. When lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic lung cancer. Metastatic lung cancer is often very difficult to treat and can be fatal.\n\nOther types of cancer, such as breast cancer, can also spread to other parts of the body. However, breast cancer is often detected early, when it is still confined to the breast. In these cases, breast cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment for breast cancer can be successful in many cases, and people with breast cancer can live long and healthy lives.\n\nThe best way to prevent cancer is to live a healthy lifestyle. This includes eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking. It is also important to get regular medical checkups so that any cancer can be detected early and treated effectively.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "Why is yeast more likely to grow in a moist, sugary environment that is acidic?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nYeast is a single-celled fungus that is found in many different environments, including soil, water, and on the skin of fruits and vegetables. Yeast is a type of microorganism that is able to convert sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is called fermentation. Yeast is used in many different industries, including the baking, brewing, and winemaking industries.\n\nYeast is more likely to grow in a moist, sugary environment that is acidic because these conditions provide the yeast with the nutrients it needs to grow. The moisture helps the yeast to absorb the sugar, and the acidity helps to create an environment that is favorable for the yeast's growth.\n\nThe following are some of the reasons why yeast is more likely to grow in a moist, sugary environment that is acidic:\n\n* Yeast needs water to survive. The water helps the yeast to absorb the sugar, which is the yeast's food.\n* Yeast needs sugar to grow. The sugar provides the yeast with the energy it needs to grow and reproduce.\n* Yeast prefers an acidic environment. The acidity helps to create an environment that is unfavorable for the growth of other microorganisms, which can compete with the yeast for food and space.\n\nIn conclusion, yeast is more likely to grow in a moist, sugary environment that is acidic because these conditions provide the yeast with the nutrients it needs to grow.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "What would happen if spaceship can fly at the speed of light?", "label": 0, "palm": "[70]\n\nAccording to the theory of relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases and time slows down. This means that if a spaceship could travel at the speed of light, its mass would become infinite and time would stop for the passengers on board. This is obviously impossible, but it is an interesting thought experiment.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why a spaceship cannot travel at the speed of light. One reason is that the energy required to accelerate a mass to the speed of light would be infinite. Another reason is that the laws of physics break down at the speed of light.\n\nHowever, there are some theories that suggest that it may be possible to travel faster than the speed of light by using wormholes or other exotic methods. If this is possible, it would open up a whole new world of possibilities for space travel.", "palm_numerical": 70}

{"prompt": "How can limestone be used to make carbon dixoide?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It is formed when the remains of marine organisms, such as coral and shellfish, are buried and compacted over time. Limestone can be used to make carbon dioxide in a number of ways.\n\nOne way is to heat limestone to a high temperature. This process, called calcination, causes the calcium carbonate to decompose into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nAnother way to make carbon dioxide from limestone is to react it with acids. For example, if you react limestone with hydrochloric acid (HCl), you will produce calcium chloride (CaCl2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nFinally, carbon dioxide can also be produced from limestone by dissolving it in water. This process, called carbonation, causes the calcium carbonate to react with the water to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2).\n\nThe confidence score I have given is based on my knowledge of the chemical properties of limestone and the different ways in which it can be used to make carbon dioxide.

{"prompt": "How long will it take to produce flour?", "label": 0, "palm": "[70]\n\nThe time it takes to produce flour depends on a number of factors, including the type of grain used, the milling process, and the desired end product. In general, it takes about 24 hours to produce flour from wheat. However, this can vary depending on the specific methods used.\n\nThe first step in producing flour is to harvest the wheat. Once the wheat is harvested, it is threshed to remove the grain from the chaff. The grain is then cleaned and dried. After the grain is dried, it is milled to produce flour. The milling process can be done using a variety of methods, including stone milling, roller milling, and air milling.\n\nThe type of milling process used will affect the quality of the flour. Stone milling is a traditional method that produces a high-quality flour. Roller milling is a more modern method that produces a lower-quality flour. Air milling is the least expensive method, but it produces the lowest-quality flour.\n\nThe desired end product will also affect the time it takes to produce flour. For example, if you are making bread, you will need to use a higher-quality flour that has been milled using a stone mill. If you are making cake, you can use a lower-quality flour that has been milled using a roller mill.\n\nIn conclusion, the time it takes to produce flour depends on a number of factors. In general, it takes about 24 hours to produce flour from wheat. However, this can vary depending on the specific methods used and the desired end product.", "palm_numerical": 70}

{"prompt": "Why is the blood inside the person constant temperature", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nThe human body has a number of mechanisms in place to maintain a constant internal temperature, or homeostasis. This is essential for the proper functioning of all the body's organs and tissues.\n\nOne of the most important mechanisms for maintaining body temperature is the hypothalamus. This is a small region of the brain that controls many of the body's automatic functions, including temperature regulation. The hypothalamus receives signals from the body's temperature sensors, and then sends signals to the rest of the body to adjust its temperature.\n\nIf the body's temperature starts to drop, the hypothalamus will send signals to the muscles to shiver. Shivering produces heat, which helps to raise the body's temperature. The hypothalamus will also send signals to the blood vessels to constrict. This reduces the flow of blood to the skin, which helps to conserve heat.\n\nIf the body's temperature starts to rise, the hypothalamus will send signals to the sweat glands to produce sweat. Sweating cools the body by evaporation. The hypothalamus will also send signals to the blood vessels to dilate. This increases the flow of blood to the skin, which helps to dissipate heat.\n\nThe body's temperature is also regulated by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces hormones that help to regulate the body's metabolism. The metabolism is the process by which the body converts food into energy. When the metabolism is high, the body produces more heat. When the metabolism is low, the body produces less heat.\n\nThe body's temperature is also regulated by the kidneys. The kidneys help to regulate the body's fluid balance. When the body is dehydrated, the kidneys produce less urine. This helps to conserve water, which helps to maintain the body's temperature. When the body is overhydrated, the kidneys produce more urine. This helps to eliminate excess water, which helps to prevent the body from overheating.\n\nThe body's temperature is also regulated by the skin. The skin is the body's largest organ, and it plays a vital role in temperature regulation. The skin contains blood vessels that can dilate or constrict to help regulate the body's temperature. The skin also contains sweat glands that produce sweat, which helps to cool the body.\n\nThe body's temperature is a vital sign that is closely monitored by doctors. A change in body temperature can be a sign of a number of medical conditions, including infection, fever, and hypothermia.", "palm_numerical": 90}

A tautology is a statement that is true by definition. In other words, it is a statement that is always true, regardless of the facts.\n\nFor example, the statement \"all bachelors are unmarried\" is a tautology. This is because the definition of a bachelor is an unmarried man. Therefore, it is always true that all bachelors are unmarried.\n\nThe statement \"a truth is correct one hundred percent\" is similar to the statement \"all bachelors are unmarried.\" It is a statement that is true by definition. In other words, it is a statement that is always true, regardless of the facts.\n\nHowever, there are some people who believe that there is no such thing as a truth. They believe that everything is relative and that there is no such thing as objective reality. These people would argue that the statement \"a truth is correct one hundred percent\" is not a tautology, but rather a statement that is false.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the statement \"a truth is correct one hundred percent\" is a tautology depends on your definition of truth.

{"prompt": "Why some people are black?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nThe skin color of humans is determined by the amount of melanin in their skin. Melanin is a pigment that protects the skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays. People with more melanin in their skin tend to have darker skin, while people with less melanin in their skin tend to have lighter skin.\n\nThe amount of melanin in a person's skin is determined by their genes. Genes are passed down from parents to children, so the skin color of a child is often similar to the skin color of their parents.\n\nThere are many different shades of skin color, and the range of skin colors in the human population is due to the variation in the genes that control melanin production.\n\nThe skin color of a person can also be affected by their environment. For example, people who live in sunny climates tend to have darker skin than people who live in cloudy climates. This is because the sun's ultraviolet rays stimulate the production of melanin in the skin.\n\nThe skin color of a person can also be affected by their diet. For example, people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables tend to have lighter skin than people who eat a lot of processed foods. This is because fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, which can help to protect the skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays.\n\nThe skin color of a person is a natural and normal variation in the human population.

The comb rows beat in a coordinated fashion to propel the ctenophore through the water.\n\nCtenophores are transparent or translucent, and they have a gelatinous body. They range in size from a few millimeters to over a meter in length. The largest ctenophore is the Venus's girdle, which can grow up to 100 meters long.\n\nCtenophores are dioecious, meaning that there are separate male and female individuals. The males release sperm into the water, and the females release eggs. The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults.\n\nCtenophores are an important part of the marine food web.

{"prompt": "why do people feel full when they eat more biscuits?", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nThere are a few reasons why people feel full when they eat more biscuits. One reason is that biscuits are high in carbohydrates, which are a type of macronutrient that the body uses for energy. When you eat carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. The glucose then travels to the cells, where it is used for energy. If you eat too many carbohydrates, your body will store the excess glucose as fat.\n\nAnother reason why people feel full when they eat more biscuits is that biscuits are high in fat. Fat is a macronutrient that the body also uses for energy. However, fat is more energy-dense than carbohydrates, which means that it takes up more space in the stomach. This can make you feel full even if you haven't eaten a lot of food.\n\nFinally, biscuits are also high in salt. Salt can help to make you feel full by increasing the amount of water that is retained in the body. This can make you feel bloated and uncomfortable.\n\nIf you are trying to lose weight, it is important to limit your intake of biscuits. Biscuits are a high-calorie food that can contribute to weight gain. Instead, choose healthier snacks that are lower in calories and fat.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "Why does a frightened sheep pretend to be dead", "label": 0, "palm": "[80]\n\nSheep are prey animals, which means they are at the bottom of the food chain and are often hunted by predators. As a result, they have evolved a number of defense mechanisms to protect themselves, including pretending to be dead. This behavior is known as thanatosis, and it is thought to be an effective way to deter predators.\n\nWhen a sheep is frightened, it will often freeze in place and become very still. It may also close its eyes and lower its head. This behavior can make the sheep look like it is dead, which can startle the predator and cause it to lose interest.\n\nThanatosis is not always successful, but it is a relatively low-cost defense mechanism that can be used by sheep of all ages and sizes. It is also a relatively harmless behavior, as the sheep does not need to expend any energy or put itself in any danger.\n\nAs a result, thanatosis is a common behavior among sheep, and it is likely that many people have seen it at some point. However, it is important to remember that this behavior is a sign of fear, and it is important to avoid disturbing the sheep if possible.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "Why the snow is just on the hill tops but not in the valley?", "label": 0, "palm": "[90]\n\nSnow is a form of precipitation that occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and freezes around tiny ice crystals. It is most common in cold climates, where the air is cold enough to support the formation of ice crystals.\n\nSnow can accumulate on the ground in a variety of ways. The most common way is for snow to fall directly from the sky. However, snow can also accumulate when cold air blows over a warmer surface, such as a lake or river. This process is called advection.\n\nSnow can also accumulate when cold air flows down a slope. This process is called avalanche.\n\nThe amount of snow that accumulates on the ground depends on a number of factors, including the temperature of the air, the amount of moisture in the air, and the slope of the land.\n\nIn general, snow will accumulate on the hilltops and not in the valley because the air is colder at higher elevations. This is because the air pressure is lower at higher elevations, which allows the water vapor in the air to condense and freeze more easily.\n\nIn addition, the slope of the land can also affect the accumulation of snow. Snow will tend to accumulate on the side of a hill that faces away from the sun, as this side of the hill will be colder.\n\nThe amount of snow that accumulates on the ground can also affect the climate. Snow reflects sunlight back into space, which helps to cool the Earth. In addition, snow can help to insulate the ground, which can help to keep the ground warm in the winter.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "where was the titanic going when it sunk?", "label": ["New York City"], "palm": "[99]\n\nThe Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.\n\nThe Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.\n\nThe ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use.\n\nThough complying with the regulations of the time, the ship carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people\u2014slightly more than half of the number on board, and one third of her total capacity. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading west to New York. On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. Just under two hours and forty minutes after Titanic hit the iceberg, she broke apart and foundered at 2:20 a.m. on 15 April, with well over one thousand people still aboard.\n\nJust under 700 people survived the disaster, which was widely reported in the global press. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.", "palm_numerical": 99}

{"prompt": "who invented the greater than and less than sign?", "label": ["Thomas Harriot"], "palm": "[90]\n\nThe greater than and less than signs are called \"inequality signs\". They are used to compare two quantities. The greater than sign (>) means that the first quantity is greater than the second quantity. The less than sign (<) means that the first quantity is less than the second quantity.\n\nThe inequality signs were invented by Thomas Harriot in the 16th century. Harriot was an English mathematician and astronomer. He is considered to be one of the founders of modern algebra.\n\nHarriot used the inequality signs in his work on algebra and geometry. He also used them in his work on navigation. Harriot's work on the inequality signs was very influential. It was used by many other mathematicians and scientists, including Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\n\nThe inequality signs are still used today in mathematics, science, and engineering. They are also used in everyday language. For example, you might say that one number is greater than another number, or that one quantity is less than another quantity.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "when did northern ireland become its own country?", "label": ["1921"], "palm": "[50]\n\nNorthern Ireland is a constituent country of the United Kingdom. It is located in the northeast of the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland was created in 1921, when the island of Ireland was partitioned into two parts: Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Free State, which became an independent country. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State was drawn in a way that kept as many Protestants as possible in Northern Ireland and as many Catholics as possible in the Irish Free State. This led to a great deal of conflict between the two communities in Northern Ireland, which is known as the Troubles. The Troubles lasted from the 1960s to the 1990s and resulted in the deaths of over 3,500 people. The Good Friday Agreement, which was signed in 1998, brought an end to the Troubles. The Good Friday Agreement created a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, which is made up of representatives from both the Protestant and Catholic communities. The Good Friday Agreement also established a number of cross-border institutions, which are designed to promote cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.", "palm_numerical": 50}

It is surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur. The cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye, and the strongest winds occur in the eyewall.\n\nThe eye of a hurricane is a region of mostly calm weather. The sky is often clear, with only a few wispy clouds. The air is warm and humid, and the sea is usually calm. The eye is so calm that it is sometimes called the \"eye of the storm.\"\n\nThe eye of a hurricane is a dangerous place to be. The winds in the eyewall can reach speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour). The waves in the eye can be as high as 15 meters (50 feet). The eye is also a dangerous place to be because of the storm surge. The storm surge is a rise in sea level that can occur when a hurricane makes landfall. The storm surge can cause extensive flooding and damage.\n\nIf you are caught in a hurricane, it is important to stay safe. The best way to stay safe is to follow the instructions of the local authorities. If you are told to evacuate, do so immediately. If you are not told to evacuate, stay indoors and away from windows.", "palm_numerical": 90}

In 1665, Hooke published a book called Micrographia, which contained illustrations of various objects he had observed under a microscope. One of these illustrations was of a thin slice of cork, which Hooke described as being made up of tiny, box-like structures. He called these structures \"cells,\" after the Latin word for \"small room.\"\n\nHooke's discovery of cells was a major breakthrough in the field of biology. It showed that all living things were made up of tiny, basic units, and it paved the way for future research into the structure and function of cells.", "palm_numerical": 90}

{"prompt": "when did the heart become associated with love?", "label": ["the 1250s"], "palm": "[80]\n\nThe heart has been associated with love for centuries. The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the seat of the soul, and the Greeks and Romans also associated it with emotions. In the Middle Ages, the heart became a symbol of love and romance. This association is still strong today, and the heart is often used as a symbol of love in art, literature, and popular culture.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for why the heart became associated with love. One possibility is that the heart's shape resembles that of a human body. The heart is also a vital organ, and it is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. This may have led people to believe that the heart was also responsible for other important functions, such as love.\n\nAnother possibility is that the association between the heart and love is based on the way that the heart feels when we are in love. When we are in love, our heart rate increases and we may feel a sense of warmth or excitement in our chest. This may have led people to believe that the heart was the source of these feelings.\n\nWhatever the reason, the association between the heart and love is a strong one that has persisted for centuries. The heart is a powerful symbol of love, and it is likely to continue to be used as such for many years to come.", "palm_numerical": 80}

It argues that the disabling barriers created by society, rather than an individual's impairment, are the main cause of disability.\n\nThe social model of disability was first developed in the 1970s by a group of disabled activists in the United Kingdom. It has since been adopted by disability rights activists and organizations around the world.\n\nThe social model of disability has been influential in shaping disability policy and practice. It has led to the development of accessible environments, such as wheelchair ramps and Braille signage, and the provision of assistive technologies, such as hearing aids and wheelchairs.\n\nThe social model of disability has also been influential in the development of disability identity politics. It has helped to empower disabled people to challenge the negative stereotypes and assumptions that are often made about them.\n\nThe social model of disability is not without its critics. Some people argue that it is too simplistic and does not take into account the individual experiences of disabled people. Others argue that it can lead to a victim mentality and can discourage disabled people from taking responsibility for their own lives.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the social model of disability remains an important tool for understanding and challenging disability oppression.", "palm_numerical": 90}

The song is full of longing and regret, as the woman knows that her love is forbidden. The song is also a reflection on the nature of love and the power of attraction.\n\nThe song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and was released in 1966. It was a hit single in the United States and the United Kingdom. The song has been covered by many artists, including Rod Stewart and The Pretenders.\n\nThe song is set in a time when social conventions were much stricter than they are today. The woman in the song is from a wealthy family and her parents would never approve of her relationship with the older man. The man is also married, which makes the relationship even more forbidden.\n\nThe woman in the song is torn between her love for the man and her duty to her family. She knows that she should end the relationship, but she can't bring herself to do it. She is drawn to the man's power and charisma, and she knows that she will never find another man like him.\n\nThe song is a classic example of a love song that is both beautiful and tragic. It is a song about the power of love and the dangers of forbidden love.", "palm_numerical": 80}

The game was released in early access for Microsoft Windows in December 2014, and was fully released for Windows, macOS, and Linux in January 2018. A port for the Xbox One was released in August 2018.\n\nThe game is set in an underwater alien world. The player takes on the role of a survivor who crash-lands on an alien planet. The player must explore the planet, gather resources, and build a base in order to survive. The game features a variety of creatures, both hostile and non-hostile, that the player must avoid or fight.\n\nSubnautica was well-received by critics, with praise for its graphics, gameplay, and atmosphere. The game has sold over 10 million copies as of January 2019.\n\nThe Xbox One version of Subnautica was released on August 21, 2018. The port was developed by Panic Button, and features all of the content from the PC version of the game. The port was well-received by critics, with praise for its performance and faithfulness to the original game.\n\nI am confident that Subnautica is a great game, and that the Xbox One version is a good port of the PC version. However, I am not sure when the game will fully come out for Xbox One. The game was released in early access for Xbox One in August 2018, but it is still in development. I am not sure when the game will be fully released for Xbox One.", "palm_numerical": 80}

{"prompt": "who benefits from a quota on imported goods to the u.s?", "label": ["producers of a good"], "palm": "[80]\n\nA quota is a limit on the amount of a good that can be imported into a country. Quotas can be used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, or to raise revenue for the government.\n\nThe main beneficiaries of quotas are the domestic producers of the goods that are being imported. Quotas raise the price of imported goods, which makes it more profitable for domestic producers to sell their goods. This can lead to increased investment in domestic production, and more jobs in the domestic industry.\n\nHowever, quotas can also have negative effects. They can lead to higher prices for consumers, and they can reduce competition in the market. This can lead to lower quality goods and services, and higher prices for consumers.\n\nOverall, the effects of quotas are mixed. They can benefit domestic producers, but they can also have negative effects on consumers and the economy.", "palm_numerical": 80}

He also argued that these institutions are often used to control and oppress people.\n\nFoucault's work has been highly influential in a number of fields, including sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies.

Kashmir is a Muslim-majority region that is claimed by both India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought four wars over Kashmir, and the region remains a major source of tension between them.\n\nIn addition to Kashmir, there are other factors that contribute to the conflict between India and Pakistan. These include religious differences, historical animosity, and the rivalry between the two countries for regional dominance.\n\nThe conflict between India and Pakistan has had a devastating impact on the people of Kashmir. The region has been the site of violence and displacement for decades. The conflict has also hampered economic development and social progress in Kashmir.\n\nDespite the challenges, there have been some efforts to resolve the conflict between India and Pakistan. In 2003, the two countries signed a ceasefire agreement. In 2005, they began a peace process that included confidence-building measures and dialogue. However, the peace process has been slow and difficult, and the conflict remains unresolved.\n\nThe conflict between India and Pakistan is a complex and intractable issue. It is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. However, it is important to continue to work towards a peaceful solution that will benefit the people of Kashmir and the region as a whole.", "palm_numerical": 90}

When lead paint chips or flakes off, it can be inhaled or ingested. This can lead to lead poisoning, which can cause a variety of health problems, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and seizures.\n\nIf you live in a home that was built before 1978, it's important to have your home tested for lead paint.

It is most commonly spread through contact with infected people or animals, or through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The most common symptoms of H1N1 infection are fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, and fatigue. In some cases, H1N1 can also cause more serious complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and encephalitis.\n\nThe animals that are most commonly known to carry H1N1 are pigs, but it can also be found in birds, horses, and other mammals. Pigs are particularly susceptible to H1N1 infection, and they can become infected with the virus through contact with infected humans or other pigs. Once infected, pigs can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. This means that humans can become infected with H1N1 by coming into contact with infected pigs or with contaminated surfaces or objects.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for H1N1 infection. However, there are a number of things that can be done to prevent the spread of the virus, such as getting a flu shot, washing your hands frequently, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.", "palm_numerical": 80}
